Creating a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.

We created a Dockerfile by creating a empty text file and renaming it to Dockerfile and then entering the following code in it.

# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:16

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3040

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

We then built a docker image by using the command "$ docker build -t yourusername/example-node-app."
